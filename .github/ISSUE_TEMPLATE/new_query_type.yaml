        ## Query Parameters |

        A query's parameters may change for each instance of your query type. For example, a `SpotPrice` query has both an `asset` and `currency` parameter. One instance of a `SpotPrice` query could have parameter values of `eth` (asset) and `usd` (currency), while another's `currency` parameter value might be `eur`. Query parameters should be styled in `mixedCase`, matching Solidity styling. The definition of your new query type's parameters must each include:
          - Parameter name (a string)
          - Description and value specification
          - Valid ABI type
          - The parameter order required for the query data bytes (more on this later)

        For example, the `SpotPrice` query type's parameters are defined as:
        
        ```
        
        1. asset
            - description: Asset ID (e.g. BTC)
            - value type: `string`
        2. currency
            - description: Selected currency (e.g. USD)
            - value type: `string`
        ```

        For a query with no parameters, `QueryWithNoParameters`, one should always include a single empty bytes argument with the name `phantom` as a convention:

        ```
        1. phantom
          - description: Empty bytes, always used for query types with no arguments
          - value type: `bytes`
        ```

    id: response-type-explanation

        ## Response Type

        Specify the ABI type as a valid ETH ABI grammar string(e.g uint256, bytes32, bytes, etc), as well as a boolean signifying whether the reponse will be packed or not when encoded to bytes. More on valid types [here](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.13/types.html).

        For example, the `SpotPrice`'s response type is an unpacked 256 bit value with 18 decimals of precision:
        
        ```
        
        - abi_type: ufixed256x18 (18 decimals of precision)
        - packed: false
        ```

This repo is a start to the education necessary for a fully decentralized oracle, but please focus on communication and working with reporters to prevent unneccesary disputes and at the same time encourage monitoring and punishment of bad data."
